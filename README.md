## 🥪 An AI Sandwich

with Humans in the Middle At a high level, **Promraw** flows the following way:

```bash
1.  A user sees a silly prompt to draw
```

```bash
2.  The user draws that prompt
```

```bash
3.  AI model scores that user's drawing and assigns a ranking
```

## 🔥How it works?

🤪 **Silly Prompts:** Users are presented with amusing and quirky prompts such as "a shark in a barrel" or "the world's fastest frog."

🖌️ **Drawing Time:** Users then draw their interpretation of the given prompt using our browser-based drawing tool.

🤖 **AI Scoring:** Once the drawing is submitted, our AI system, Paint, scores the drawing using CLIP, a model trained on image-text pairs. The closer the user's drawing is to the prompt's image representation according to CLIP, the higher the score.

## ⌨️ How We Generate Prompts?

We didn't stop at just a few prompts; we used AI to generate thousands of creative prompts! Here's how:

- **Initial Prompts**: We started with a set of initial prompts.
- **AI Prompt Generation**: Leveraging GPT-2, a generative text model, we expanded our prompt collection to include thousands of unique and unexpected ideas.
- **Human Touch**: While AI generated most of the prompts, our team ensured that they all encouraged fun and creativity.

## 🌐⛓️ Some extra sparkle from Blockchain/Web3:

- 🖼️ **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):** Users can convert their submitted drawings into NFTs, representing unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on a marketplace. Each drawing could be minted as a separate NFT, enabling users to monetize their creativity and potentially earn rewards for high-scoring submissions.
- 💰**Tokenized Rewards:** Users are rewarded with tokens or cryptocurrency for participating in the game, submitting drawings, or achieving high scores.
- 🏠 **Private room:** With this feature, users can create exclusive drawing sessions where only those with the room link or code can participate just like Scribble.
- 🏆 **Community Challenges and Tournaments:** Organize tournaments where users compete to create the best drawings based on specific themes, with winners receiving rare NFTs or valuable rewards.
